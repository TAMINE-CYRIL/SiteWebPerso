<h1>About Me </h1>
<p>
Since I was a child, I have always been drawn to digital professions. At first, I wanted to specialize myself in video
  games, however, during my University Bachelor of Technology, I discovered many interesting fields in Programming :
  Frontend, Backend, Java, Python, C++, Databases, AI. There are so many fields I want to try, so many languages
  I want to learn. I really aspire to be a complete developer !

<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p> I have so many hobbies I don't even have enough time to do everything ! I enjoy reading any kind of books, it
could either be a novel, a manga, a comic and even plays !
</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>Of course, programming is one of the favorite thing I like to do on my computer; I like to create as
much as I can : websites, games... as long as I have fun and I try something new. For this website, this is the
first time I try to create a website for myself. Also, I really want to improve my CSS skills, and I'm trying to make
this website good-looking.</p>
