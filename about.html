<h1>About Me </h1>
<p>I was born in Marseille, France, the 11th May, 2005.
Since I was a child, I always wanted to work in digital [métiers]. At first, I wanted to specialize myself in video
  games, however, during my University Bachelor of Technology, I discovered many interesting domains in Programming :
  PHP, Java, Python, C++, Databases. There are so many fields I want to try, so many languages I want to learn. I really
  want to be a complete developer !

</p>

<h1>Education</h1>
<p>
  I got my Baccaulaureate in Lycée Artaud in Marseille, with highest honour, specializing myself in Computer Science.
</p>

 <p>
   I am currently at Aix-Marseille IUT on my second year of BUT Computing.
 </p>

<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p> I have so many hobbies I don't even have enough time to do everything ! I enjoy reading any kind of books, it
could either be a novel, a manga, a comic and even plays ! Here's some of my favorite:</p>
<p>Ashita no Joe | The Little Prince | Umineko no naku koro ni | Les Miserables | The Call of the Wild</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>Of course, programming is one of the favorite thing I like to do on my computer; I like to create as
much as I can : websites, games... as long as I have fun and I try something new. For this website, this is the
first time I try to create a website for myself. Also, I really want to improve my CSS skills, and I'm trying to make
this website good-looking.</p>

<h2>Drawing</h2>

<h2>Playing Games</h2>
<p>Video games is the main reason I wanted to study Computer Science. Even though I entered college, I still find time
to play, either on my computer or my phone, here's some of my favorites games of all time !
</p>
<p>Minecraft | Tales of Berseria | Pokemon White 2 | Super Smash Bros Brawl</p>
